iZend is a PHP engine for developing well structured web applications 
with a content manager. It's aimed at programmers who want full 
control on the code they use with maximum adaptability and 
reusability. It's simple to understand, easy to extend, open to other 
components in PHP, Javascript or Flash. The goal is to let it become 
your own very quickly while still keeping all the benefits of using a 
software program which is constantly enriched by an open source 
community.

iZend is built with a straightforward architecture specially 
designed for organizing publications in several languages and for
different media. It includes a content editor, a set of presentation 
models, a search engine and a payment system. It can manage a 
community of users with specific privileges.

iZend is normally hosted by a LAMP like web server but it can work
without a database and take very little space on disk. Put online a
a multimedia website in several languages with a contact page in 
just a few minutes!

Start with the installation guide on www.izend.org.

Thank you for your interest in iZend!
