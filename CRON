Program the cron system service by adding a file called izend in /etc/cron.d
with the following content:

# /etc/cron.d/izend: crontab for iZend
# Runs cron.php every quarter of an hour for every site.

*/15 * * * * www-data [ -f /var/www/sitename.net/cron.php ] && /usr/bin/php5 -f /var/www/sitename.net/cron.php

cron.php will run every script file located in the cron directory.

You may want to uncomment the following line in the configuration file of the
syslog utility to be notified by mail in case of error:

cron.*				/var/log/cron.log
