Program the cron system service by adding a file called izend in /etc/cron.d
with the following content:

# /etc/cron.d/izend: crontab for iZend
# Runs cron.php every quarter of an hour for every site.

*/15 * * * * www-data [ -f /var/www/sitename.net/cron.php ] && /usr/bin/php5 -f /var/www/sitename.net/cron.php

cron.php will run every script file located in the cron directory.

syslog utility to be notified by mail in case of error:

cron.*				/var/log/cron.log
